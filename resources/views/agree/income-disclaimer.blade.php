While the opportunity is unlimited, individual results will certainly vary depending on many factors, such as commitment level, individual effort and marketing skills. Since we are in the process of pre-launching, we lack enough statistical data to prepare reliable income disclosures.</span>

<p style="margin: 10.2pt 0in 10.2pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',serif;">The numbers above reflect estimates prepared by the company pending a more detailed survey to be conducted after its first year. If income projections were presented to you prior to your enrollment, such projections are not representative of the income, if any, that you can or will earn through your participation in the Referral Plan.</span>

<p style="margin: 10.2pt 0in 10.2pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',serif;">These income projections should not be considered as guarantees or projections of your actual earnings or profits. Success with the company results only from active participation and successful marketing efforts, which do require work, commitment and diligence on your part.</span>
